# Bsc-Thesis-group-15
Questions for Meeting with supervisor:
- Whats the objective of our project?
  Could you help us better understand what the main goal should be, and how we can clearly define it
- could you advise us on how to divide the overall project into three subprojects, and how we can clearly define the subobjectives?
- We're a bit unclear on how to approach the literature review for our topic, could make suggestions on how we should get started?

Company Meeting Questions:

What is the expectation from you for our thesis? Are we only making a report on the different models, are we making a model, should we build on the existing website?
--What do you consider a succesfull project?
-- what is most important factor? Is it model costs or data safety?

Is there some idea that you have on how we will split the project up into 3 parts (other then our ideas)
